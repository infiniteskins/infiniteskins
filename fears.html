    <h1>Fears</h1>
    <p class="date">August 5, 2025</p>

    <!-- Your writing starts here -->
    <p> My day started well. With a glimmer. I heard back from someone. No progress, but I consider receiving a reply a win these days.</p>
     
    <p> Why am I doing this journal? writing? doing? I think 'doing' is the correct verb, because I'm doing a lot more than just write, 
      aren't I? 
      You know I just resisted the urge to quickly check if the previous sentence is grammatically accurate. Can you believe that 
      I'm not relying on any grammar corrections tools? This is a humble brag, my readers. I don't need autocorrect or spellcheck. 
      The countless spelling and grammar tests I was expected to ace in my childhood... are finally paying off. 
      Yet to find a use for 'mitochondria is the powerhouse...' though.</p>
    
    <p>so, fears. I have lived most of my in fear. Don't get me wrong, I come across as a supremely confident being. 
      Very self assured, intimidating (some have called me, or blunt). I wore these adjectives as badges of honour. </p>
    <p> I am confident, but I am also afraid. I grew up in a place where acquiescence is a virtue. Docility is noble. 
    And, I had neither of these attributes. I tried very hard, at a point in my life, to be a good 'follower', but failed. I love that I failed. </p>
    <p>I have a mind of my own, I take great pride in it. Even as a child, I remember having thoughts and opinions. That pissed off a lot of people. 
    I was once thrown out of class for knowing all the answers. The teacher got annoyed that I already knew what she was planning to teach, so she
    she made me stand outside. I remember feeling indignant. </p>
   
    <p> I have fought many battles, won a few, lost many, to be where I am now. And I am afraid, it will be taken away from me.
    But, what will they take away? I enjoy going for walks in the clean, crisp air, without the fear of being harrassed. I am living in a 
    country on a visa. I have not yet secured my long term stay here, and I am afraid I will have to go back to where I came from. </p>

    <p> I remember my days in my home country. I always felt like I was holding in my breath, afraid to take up space. I didn't show my fear though.
    My fears manifested as anxiety and later, depression. Which is one of the reasons why I am keeping this anonymous.
    I am not expecting a lot of people to read this. I just feel safe in obscurity and free in the fact that I am taking up space in the world. I am speaking in a void, but the message is still going out there. </p>
    <p> My primary fear is just that - I don't want to feel suffocated again. I know I won't have to live that again. I'm just voicing it out,
      so that it's out of my head. Despite my fear, I am hopeful. </p>
     <p> The fears are mostly around my self expression being denied its proper place. My desires, my dreams, my joy being denied its proper place. 
     </p>
    <p> But, these are just fears. Trappings of my mind. The voice of the anxious child who always knew she would break free, 
    but didn't know when. She is afraid she will lose everything she's worked so hard for. The grownup is here to remind her that she won't. 
    She has me. She has me protecting her and making her dreams come true. I have become my protector and saviour. </p>
    
   
    <p> My journey has been interesting, traumatic, fun, funny, ironic, average yet exceptional.</p>
