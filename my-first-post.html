    <h1>Attention</h1>
    <p class="date">August 4, 2025</p>

    <!-- Your writing starts here -->
    <p> I am sitting on my sofa, listening to a "women of jazz" playlist. As I listen, I’m watching myself in my head? almost like a second person in the room, watching myself be. 
      And then it struck me... </p>
     
    <p> I don’t give a shit about tenses at the moment, I am writing for myself, am I not? aren’t i? why the fuck am I editing my thoughts? 
      So, the thought that struck me… wait, even if I publish this, I will publish it as it is. 
      I think some women may find this relatable. Even if they don’t, does it matter? why am I thinking about this… </p>
    
    <p>so, the thought that struck me was that we, women, are so used to being observed. From childhood, we are watched, we are taught to perform under attention. </p>
    <p> (A lot has been written about this, I won't get into culture and media commentary. This is not the place for critical analysis.) </p>
   
    <p> Except when I’m with a few friends (I can count them on one hand), I’m always performing under someone’s gaze. 
        Hyper aware that they are watching me. I know I am being watched, even when I’m not. </p>

    <p> I remember I was sitting across someone, a week ago, drinking wine. I said something to make him laugh. I could see that he was really into me and the conversation. </p>
    <p> I can recall the moment so vividly, I was sitting with my left knee bent, foot on the chair.
      My split denim skirt exposing the knee. I could feel his gaze travel across my body. </p>
    <p> And what I was doing in this moment? Observing us, in my head. Filing the interaction, like a petty admin. </p>
    
   
    <p> I think one writer wrote about this very phenomenon, men watch women, and women watch themselves being watched by men or something on these lines? 
        (I know the author and the quote and the book, but at the time of writing this, I couldn't recall any of it.) </p>

    <p>Not just men, but society watches women. What we wear, how loud we laugh, our language, our expressions. Our confidence. Us. 
       When I walk, with confidence, I am watched. </p>
    
<p> I am done being watched. I am living now. I don’t care. If I find you watching, I will watch you. I will look you straight in the eyes till you look away. </p>

<p> My confidence isn’t for your pleasure. Look away. Are you in awe of me? Are you scared? Are you annoyed? Whatever it is you are feeling, look away and let me walk. </p>
