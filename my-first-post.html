    <h1>Attention</h1>
    <p class="date">August 4, 2025</p>

    <!-- Your writing starts here -->
    <p> I am sitting on my sofa, listening to a "women of jazz" playlist. As I listen, I’m watching myself in my head? almost like a second person in the room, watching myself be. 
      And then it struck me... </p>
     
    <p> I don’t give a shit about tenses at the moment, I am writing for myself, am I not? aren’t i? why the fuck am I editing my thoughts? 
      So, the thought that struck me… wait, even if I publish this, I will publish it as it is. 
      I think some women may find this relatable. Even if they don’t, does it matter? why am I thinking about this… </p>
    
    <p>so, the thought that struck me was that we, women, are so used to being observed. From childhood, we are watched, we are taught to perform under attention. </p>
    <p> Except when I’m with a few friends (I can count them on one hand), I’m always performing under someone’s gaze. 
        Hyper aware that they are watching me. I know I am being watched, even when I’m not. </p>
    <p> I think one writer wrote about this, men watch women, and women watch themselves being watched by men or something on these lines? 
        (I know the author and the quote, but at the time of writing this, I couldn't recollect any of these things) </p>
     <p>Not just men, but society watches women. What we wear, how loud we laugh, our language, our expressions. Our confidence. Us. 
       When I walk, with confidence, I am watched. </p>
<p> I am done being watched. I am living now. I don’t care. If I find you watching, I will watch you. I will look you straight in the eyes till you look away. </p>

<p> My confidence isn’t for your pleasure. Look away. Are you in awe of me? Are you scared? Are you annoyed? Whatever your feeling is, look away and let me walk. </p>
