    <h1>Love</h1>
    <p class="date">August 7, 2025</p>

    <!-- Your writing starts here -->
    <p> Love has visited me in many forms. Most recently, as friendship. My friends, who I love to death, have dragged me out of spirals so uncontrollable, 
      when I felt like I wouldn't stop falling.</p>
     
    <p> The first time I met love, at 17, I didn't recognise it. I fell for the boy at first sight, but it was merely infatuation. We dated for a few years. I called it off, for 
    idealistic reasons. he had betrayed my trust. When I lost him, I realised I loved him. Silly, young, me. It was love in the form of acceptance. The boy
    liked and respected me for who I was. The first person who thought I wasn't too much. </p>
    
    <p>I had yearned for that acceptance for many years. The next time love visited me, it was quiet. I woke up and realised I was in love, fully, completely, wholly with
    this person. I was in love because I liked being with him so so very much. We had fun doing nothing. I could share my dreams, my darkness, my lightness, my joy, my anger, 
      my beliefs, my inconsistencies, with him. I made him my safe place. </p>
      When it ended, I remember forgetting how to breathe. I called a friend and told him 'I feel like someone has punched a hole in my torso. I am empty. 
    I can't breathe. I have a void in me that's sucking everything in.' </p>
    <p> Why are my journal entries so morose? It gets better, I promise. Not in the way, you'd think. 'Don't Look Back in Anger' just came on 
      the radio (literally, as I am typing this) ... 
      how fitting</p>
    <p> These two versions of love defined my idea of love, or the absence of it, for many years. I went through a lot in these years, some people call it trauma, I call it life.</p>
    <p> Everyone has their own shit, don't we? </p>
    <p> I have now discovered, that I always had love. I always will. It resides within me. So far, I have only shared how these two old 'loves' made me feel. What I have left out, in this entry and 
    my narrative, is how I loved them, deeply, passionately, and warmly.</p>

    <p> And, now, I am doing it for myself. </p>
    <p> I don't like what I have written so far. It's an honest reflection, but it sounds disingenuous.</p>
     <p> Why? Because, I feel like I am not doing a good job of loving myself. But, love isn't supposed to be perfect, is it? </p>
    <p> Why do we make so many concessions for others but have no grace for ourselves? </p>
    <p>I have been self critical for so long. I have survived so much.
       I have been angry at myself for putting myself through what I have survived. I have been grieving, for the past few years. </p>
    <p> The five stages aren't linear. Today, I feel acceptance, which is why I am writing about love. There are days 
      I wake up feeling angry or depressed. 
      The good part, the greatest part, is that denial and negotiation are long gone. 
      They will not return. The fire that burns inside me won't let them.
     </p>
    <p> 'Grief is love with no place to go', you must have come across this quote in one for or another. And, I agree. I have been grieving loss of self, mostly. And, now, I am making
    a place for the love within me. The intensity of this grief has shocked me but given me hope. It has shown me how intensely and wholly I need to love myself.</p>
